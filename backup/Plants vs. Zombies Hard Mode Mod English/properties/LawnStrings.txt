Listen: Let's grow two rows of sunflowers ―
I'm very, very serious!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_15]
The stinky snail apparently likes his chocolate
. Maybe I like it a little too much, you know
huh? After eating some chocolate, he had a moment
I don't want to calm down either. 

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_16]
If you think you want to play the endless version of survival mode, only
If aquatic plants appear, think twice
Think about it! There will be every kind of plant here
。

, there's no reason to stop you from doing this?

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_23]

Want to get rich fast? Then play survival mode
Endless edition! Then remember to put your bank
Send me the account number!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_27]
 You've probably thought torch stumps would wipe out the ice
beans. Then you're right because of you, me
My friend is a smart guy.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_28]
 These hateful botanical zombies! They used
For who you are, how dare you go to your plants
Fire? A wall of nuts will keep them calm
Give it a try.

If you start on the right, smash the vase and go swimming
The play just got a lot simpler.”

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_35]
I'm a zombie in mode, the King of Dance Zombies sees
It's a bit pricey, but when you need it,
It's definitely worth every penny you spend.


[TREE_OF_WISDOM_36]
 I had a dream. In my dream, cattails
The stinger pierced the balloon, and then the zombie
It fell to the ground. I didn't know this dream had
What does it mean.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_37]
If you don't have an aquarium, you want to go to a Zen garden
I'm afraid it's impossible to grow aquatic plants in it
. Uh... I'm just talking about it.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_38]
 This kind of drilling behavior of miner zombies, Jane
It's just a violation of the laws of nature, use
Magnetic mushrooms suck their mining hoes away! That's it
Fair enough.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_39]
 Every day brings new challenges, new ones
Opportunities, oh, and Crazy Dave's Store
Inside the new calendula.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_40]
Mushroom garden! Hmm! What does it do? Very
Obviously, it can only be used to grow mushrooms,
That's it!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_41]
 Tired? Depressed? Stand on tall nuts
Are the ladders making you uncomfortable? A magnetic force
Mushrooms can make these disappear fast!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_42]
The height of the high nuts won everyone's praise
, because they are dealing with Dolphin Knight zombies,
Jumping zombies are pretty cool.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_43]

Measure, and the one that knocked the ladder off the nut wall
The former is much more powerful.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_44]
Feed all the chocolate to the stinky snails?
Very tempting indeed. He really liked it
chocolate. But don't forget: Meditation Garden
The plants inside love chocolate too!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_45]
 The fire at the torch stump was unusually intense, but
It's zombies, iron fences, escalators, and throwing cars
Can withstand heat

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_46]
If you rely on upgrades in survival mode
Things, pay attention to the more you have on the grass
This plant will make this plant more expensive.


[TREE_OF_WISDOM_47]
Ghosts look great in “I am a zombie”
weak. But when you get rid of other enemies
Wait, they'll get used to that tempting brain
Extremely fast.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_48]
If you type “trickedout”, no
Be surprised if it happened to your lawn mower
Strange thing.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_49]
Thanks for feeding me! I'm a bit lacking in new ones
That's wisdom. But if you plant mine

Oh sorry... I just released a little
oxygen.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_203]
Oh my god, I have grown leaves!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_204]
I feel like I'm about to explode!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_205]

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_305]

The Earth revolves around the Sun, not for us to see
At that point, it seemed like the Sun orbiting the Earth
Turn.


[TREE_OF_WISDOM_401]

It's less and it's easier to hallucinate.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_402]
If you don't understand, what is a forest
What is a tree, just remember. Forests are trees
A collection of individuals, not the other way around.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_403]
History keeps repeating himself, but
Some details are always different.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_404]
If we talk about the past, present, and future, at the same time
Existence is a “reincarnation”, then
The “now” that has been tested can only be described as meticulous
An illusion of production?

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_405]
Courage is easy to come by; dedication is hard to find.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_500]
These are tried and tested wisdom...

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_600]
Please give me something to eat!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_800]

They left a small chrysanthemum when they died.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_900]
啊哈！我500英尺高了！来点舞
Let's do the same! Type “dance” and let the zombies
Let's all swing!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_1000]
喔！我已经1000英尺高了！和我
Type “pinata” together and let the zombies
Spit out candy when you die, let's celebrate!
